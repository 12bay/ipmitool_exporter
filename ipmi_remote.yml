# Configuration file for ipmitool_exporter

# This is an example config for scraping remote hosts via IPMI.
# Information required to access remote IPMI interfaces can be supplied in the
# 'modules' section. A scrape can request the usage of a given config by
# setting the `module` URL parameter.

modules:
        default:
                # These settings are used if no module is specified, the
                # specified module doesn't exist, or of course if
                # module=default is specified.
                user: "default_user"
                pass: "default_pass"
                # The below settings correspond to privilege-level and
                # session-timeout respectively
                privilege: "administrator"
                # The session timeout is in seconds. Note that a scrape can take up
                # to (session-timeout * #-of-collectors) seconds, so set the scrape
                # timeout in Prometheus accordingly.
                timeout: 5
                # Available collectors are sensor, fru, and fwum
                # If not specified, all three are used
                collectors:
                - fru
                - sensor
                - fwum
        example:
                user: "example_user"
                pass: "example_pass"
                privilege: "administrator"
                timeout: 5
                collectors:
                - fru
                - sensor
